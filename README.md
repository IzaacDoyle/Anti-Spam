# Anti-Spam

Anti-Spam is a mobile app designed to protect Android users from fraudulent activities in real-time. Developed using Kotlin in Android Studio, the app automatically blocks unwanted phone calls and displays warning overlays when malicious SMS messages are detected. It also allows users to manually blacklist numbers or keywords and customize their security settings.
What sets Anti-Spam apart is its extensive and updated database of blacklisted numbers, ensuring users are protected from the latest threats.
Unlike other spam-blocking apps, Anti-Spam does not require users to modify their default dialer app, making it more convenient to use. The app also allows users to report suspicious numbers, to create a community-driven security network that can efficiently block scammers and fraudulent activity.
